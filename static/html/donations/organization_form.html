<div ng-show="!is_edit">
  <p>
    Any non-profit organization can be listed to receive donations. If
    your organization or project is not legally a non-profit but fits
    the goals of the Freicoin Foundation (stated on the home page) you
    can still submit a request to receive funds issued by the Freicoin
    Foundation in proportion to the donations you receive through this web.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although the foundation will only match Freicoin donations, please,
    provide a Bitcoin donation address just in case your donors donate
    Bitcoins by accident.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation will complement Freicoin donations with the
    foundation's issuance funds, increasing the amount by 10%.
