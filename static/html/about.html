    <a href="http://freico.in/">Freicoin</a> is a p2p currency based
    on Bitcoin and Silvio Gesell's Freigeld.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although mining is necessary for security, it consumes real world
    resources and it is not necessary to issue 100% of the total
    initial monetary base through mining in order to secure the
    network. The Freicoin Foundation will issue 80% of the initial
    monetary base to prevent this wasteful issuance (that maximizes
    the costs of production to minimize seigniorage) and to experiment
    with new issuance mechanisms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is to distribute the 80 million FRC before 2016. After
    this 3 year period the monetary base will remain stable at 100
    million FRC and the 5% demurrage will be distributed p2p. This 3
    year timeframe is a compromise between the foundation as a tool to
    bootstrap the currency and the need of an eventual removal of the
    issuance role of the foundation in order for the currency to
    become purely p2p. That means the annual 5% will go in full to
    miners if no alternative has been found.
  </p>

  <p>
    The challenge is to design schemes in which the foundation doesn't
    have much control over the final issuance decisions while at the
    same time it can ensure transparency and that funds aren't issued
    against the foundation's principles.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a fully p2p issuance mechanism alternative to mining is found,
    a mechanism (for example, proof-of-stake voting) could be
    established to determine how much goes to security (miners) and
    how much to the alternative.
