    The Freicoin Foundation seeks to create a world where commonplace
    non-usurious complementary currencies inspired by the works of Silvio
    Gesell are brought into being through economic development, charitable
    action, and the support of global commons and which engender perpetual
    prosperity through sustainable development.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Freicoin Foundation will issue 80% of the total initial
    Freicoins through several issuance mechanisms that are safe from
    potential corruption from the Foundation management team itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of those mechanisms is to match Freicoin and Bitcoin donations
    to non-profits listed on this site. The foundation will
    periodically give away some freicoin to those organizations in
    proportion to how much they have received in donations through
    this site. Help decide how the Foundation's funds are going to be
    used by donating to your preferred <b>non-profits</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're a non-profit organization that fits the goals of the
    Freicoin Foundation, <b>register</b> in this site and start receiving
    Freicoin and Bitcoin donations as well as newly issued Freicoins.
