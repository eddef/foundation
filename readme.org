* Installation

You should only have virtualbox as dependency.

After cloning the repository, you may want to edit the file .env to
set your own settings, for example, for setting a smtp account.

Once you have it the dependencies installed, in the project's root
type:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
make run
#+END_SRC

To start the server or to start a python interactive shell with access
to the project's modules:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make shell
#+END_SRC

Please, contact us if these instructions aren't enough or can be
completed for the system you're using.
