<h3>Merchant edit form:</h3>

<p>
  If you're a merchant that accepts Freicoin as payment you should
  advertise yourself for free here.
</p>
  
<p>
  If you accept donations but your organization doesn't qualify as
  non-profit you can also advertise yourself to receive Freicoin
  donations here. The foundation won't increase the donations you
  receive through this section.
